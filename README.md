# Data Structures and Algorithms Programs

This repository contains my implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignments during my 3rd Semester at LGU. The programs are written in C++, and each directory corresponds to a specific topic or assignment.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of DSA programs that I worked on during my university studies. The implementations cover a wide range of topics, including data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, queues, stacks, and algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning or academic purposes. Keep in mind that these implementations may serve as a starting point, and it's recommended to understand the concepts thoroughly before using them in your projects.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on specific DSA topics or assignments. Here's a brief overview:

- **[Queues]:** Implementation of queue data structure and related algorithms.
- **[Stacks]:** Implementation of stack data structure and related algorithms.
- **[Linked Lists]:** Implementation of linked list data structure and related algorithms.
- **[Trees]:** Implementation of tree data structure and related algorithms.
- **[Sorting Algorithms]:** Implementation of various sorting algorithms in C++.

Feel free to navigate through the directories to find relevant programs and explore their implementations.

## Usage

To use the programs in this repository, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-programs.git
# Conclusion:
Keep in mind that the code is provided as-is, and it's recommended to understand the logic behind each implementation before using them in your projects or assignments.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or improvements to suggest!
